# VCA sandbox — Project Overview

**Owner:** Charles Hu, Staff Product Designer, LinkedIn  
**Project Type:** Internal Design Tool

---

## What It Is

A workspace where chatbot designers can quickly prototype conversation flows using standardized, reusable UI components.

---

## Background: What is VCA?

VCA (Virtual Chat Assistant) is LinkedIn's AI-powered customer support chat feature. Across LinkedIn products like Sales Navigator, Recruiter, and Admin Center, users can access help through a chat interface where an AI agent answers their questions. If the AI can't help, users can escalate to a human support agent.

This sandbox helps designers create better conversation flows for VCA.

## The Problem We're Solving

Designers currently recreate the same chat interface from scratch in Figma for every new conversation flow they design (like "Remove User," "Cancel Subscription," etc.). This creates three major issues:

1. **Wasted time** — Designers waste time redrawing screens instead of focusing on the conversation itself
2. **Inconsistency** — Each designer uses slightly different versions of components, leading to confusion and quality issues
3. **Hard to test** — Static Figma mockups make it difficult to experience how a conversation actually flows and identify problems before engineering handoff
4. **Hard to ideate** — Static Figma mockups make it difficult to try and share new interaction patterns

## Who It's For

**Primary Users:** Chatbot designers at LinkedIn

**Secondary Users:** Product managers and engineers at LinkedIn who need to review conversation flows

This is an internal tool built for LinkedIn employees working on the Virtual Chat Assistant (VCA) product.

## Core Features

1. **Component Library** — Browse all VCA chat components (buttons, message bubbles, inputs, etc.) in one organized reference
2. **Flow Preview** — Click through conversation flows in a realistic chat interface to test how dialogues actually work
3. **Builder** — Visual editor to configure chat logic and swap components

## Our Goals

### Immediate Goal (MVP)
Enable designers to stop recreating the chat UI and instead focus their energy on designing better conversations.

### Success Looks Like
- Designers can browse all available chat components in one place
- Designers can test conversation flows in a realistic chat environment
- The sandbox becomes the single source of truth for VCA component designs

### Long-term Vision
Create a self-service tool where anyone can quickly prototype, test, and refine chatbot conversations without needing design or engineering support for every iteration. Production code is shipped directly from the tool.

---

## Why This Matters

Better conversation design = happier users interacting with our chatbot.

When designers can iterate faster and test more thoroughly, we ship higher-quality experiences that actually solve customer problems instead of frustrating them. We reduce time and effort used to design new experiences.
