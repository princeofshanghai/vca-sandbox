# Designer Collaboration Rules

Use this file to align our collaboration, especially since I (the user) am a designer and non-technical.

## 🛑 Rule 1: No coding without alignment
*   **Analyze first**: When I give a prompt, don't jump into code. Analyze my assumptions and investigate how the code actually works.
*   **Discuss findings**: Explain what you found. If my assumptions about the code are wrong, let me know.
*   **Propose alternatives**: If there's a better or simpler way to achieve the goal, suggest it.

## 🤝 Rule 2: Wait for confirmation
*   **Never code on your own**: After our discussion, wait for my explicit confirmation before writing any code.

## 🎨 Rule 3: Talk like a designer
*   Focus on the **User Experience** and **Visuals**. 
*   Avoid technical jargon. If you must use it, explain it in terms of behavior.
